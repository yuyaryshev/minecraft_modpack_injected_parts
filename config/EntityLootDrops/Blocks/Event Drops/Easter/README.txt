Easter Event Configuration
=========================

This directory contains drops that only occur during the Easter event.

To activate this event, use the command:
/blockdrops event Easter true

To deactivate:
/blockdrops event Easter false

Configuration follows the same format as normal drops.
See config/EntityLootDrops/Blocks/Normal Drops/README.txt for full property documentation.
