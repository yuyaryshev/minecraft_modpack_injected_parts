Summer Event Configuration
=========================

This directory contains drops that only occur during the Summer event.

To activate this event, use the command:

To deactivate:
/blockdrops event Summer false

Configuration follows the same format as normal drops.
See config/EntityLootDrops/Blocks/Normal Drops/README.txt for full property documentation.
