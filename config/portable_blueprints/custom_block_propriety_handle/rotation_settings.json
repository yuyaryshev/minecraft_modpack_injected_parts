//Introduction to using Custom Block Property Handle Rotation:
//Here you can modify the final result of any blocks you want during blueprint rotation.
//Warning: once you add any block here, it will no longer be affected by the automatic rotation handled by the mod!
//The mod already includes an internal file like this, but any block you define here will override the internal one and take priority. (Priority order is always: user settings > mod default)
//For details on how to use this file, please refer to the wiki on the mod’s GitHub: https://github.com/Nimblonia/Mod_Portable_blueprint_Community/discussions/17
